 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>The adoption of tier stacking (dual deck) leads to increasingly high aspect ratios and poses challenges in controlling overlay, tilt, and misalignment in the manufacturing processes for next generation 3D NAND devices. In this work we address metrology challenges such as tilt and overlay separation, measurement robustness influenced by process variation, and nonlinearity of spectral response to asymmetries. We show that Mueller measurement can separate overlay and tilt signals through distinct spectral response analyzed by a machine learning method with reference data. To reduce asymmetry measurement errors caused by process variation such as critical dimension (CD) and thickness changes, we propose and demonstrate improvement of tilt measurements on blind test wafers by feeding forward CD measurement results to the analysis of tilt signal. We also investigate nonlinear regression and show its capability to extend overlay measurement limit from linear response range, ±0.25pitch, to ±0.43pitch. In addition, for small structural asymmetries introduced by channel hole tilt, test RMSE is reduced by 20–40% from nonlinear regression alone or combined with CD feed-forward. We demonstrate that spectroscopic Mueller matrix measurements, paired with advanced machine learning analysis, provide nondestructive and accurate measurement of tilt, overlay, and misalignment for 3D NAND devices with high throughput and fast recipe creation.</i></p>

 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>The present study focuses on the development and application of a computational framework for assessing the effects of fuel sloshing in internal fuel tanks on the aeroelastic characteristics of aircraft wing configurations. The framework couples an open source compressible flow solver for external aerodynamics, a structural solver for computing the structural motion/deformation and an open source Volume of Fluid (VOF) solver for fuel sloshing in internal wing fuel tanks. As time domain flutter solution of these coupled solvers is computationally expensive, a reduced order model (ROM) is developed for prediction of sloshing loads based on structural inputs. The aim of the ROM is to efficiently describe the dominant static and dynamic characteristics of the underlying system by employing radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NN) to train the dynamic relationship between the structural motions and resulting sloshing loads. A limited CFD-based data is exploited to calibrate the ROM. Hence, a specially designed structural input is required to efficiently capture all the relevant dynamics of the system. A white-noise random signal-based input design method is developed and utilized for the same purpose. The flutter boundary is compared for clean wing section with and without internal fuel tank for different fill levels. The computational framework applied to a wing section with an internal tank has demonstrated promising results motivating feasibility of an extension to a three-dimensional wing with an internal fuel tank.</i></p>

 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>The present study focuses on the development, application, and comparison of three computational frameworks of varying fidelities for assessing the effects of fuel sloshing in internal fuel tanks on the aeroelastic characteristics of a wing section. The first approach uses the coupling of compressible flow solver for external aerodynamics integrated with structural solver and incompressible multiphase flow solver for fuel sloshing in the embedded fuel tank As time-domain flutter solution of these coupled solvers is computationally expensive, two approximate surrogate models to emulate sloshing flows are considered. One surrogate model utilizes a linearised approach for sloshing load computations by creating an Equivalent Mechanical System (EMS) with its parameters derived from potential flow theory. The other surrogate model aims to efficiently describe the dominant dynamic characteristics of the underlying system by employing the Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN) using limited CFD-based data to calibrate this model. The flutter boundaries of a wing section with and without the effects of fuel sloshing are compared. The limitation of the EMS surrogate to represent nonlinearities are reflected in this study. The RBF-NN surrogate shows remarkable agreement with the high-fidelity solution for sloshing with significantly low computational cost, thereby motivating extension to three-dimensional problems.</i></p>

 							<p><li  style="font-size:1.5vw"><b>Machine Learning Surrogates for Predicting Response of an Aero-Structural-Sloshing System</b></li>
 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing machine learning (ML) surrogates based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for predicting the unsteady aeroelastic response of transonic pitching and plunging wing-fuel tank sloshing system by considering an approximate simplified model of an airfoil in transonic flow and sloshing loads from a partially filled fuel tank rigidly embedded inside the airfoil and undergoing a free unsteady motion. The ML surrogates are then used to predict the aeroelastic response of the coupled system. The external aerodynamic loads on the airfoil and the two-phase sloshing loads data for training the RNN are generated using open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. The aerodynamic force and moment coefficients are predicted from the surrogate model based on its motion history. Similarly, the lateral and vertical forces and moments from fuel sloshing in the fuel tank are predicted using the surrogate model resulting from the motion of the embedded fuel tank. Comparing the free motion of the airfoil without sloshing tank to the free motion of the airfoil with a partially-filled fuel tank shows that the effects of sloshing on the aeroelastic motion of the aero-structural system. The effectiveness of the predictions from RNN are then assessed by comparing with the results from the high-fidelity coupled aero-structural-fuel tank sloshing simulations. It is demonstrated that the surrogate models can accurately and economically predict the coupled aero-structural motion.</i></p>

 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>In this work, to demonstrate the efficiency of model reduction in design optimization, a parametric reduced-order model (PROM) was adopted in conjunction with an aeroelastic optimization process. Flutter speed was chosen as an objective function, and structural properties (material density, Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio) as well as fluid properties (air density) were defined as the design variables. The flutter calculation was performed for a Goland wing, using finite-element modeling for the structure and the vortex lattice method for the aerodynamic part. A gradient-based optimization technique and a global optimization method were used to seek a maximum flutter speed. Comparison of optimization results from the full-order model (FOM) and PROM shows that the proposed optimization process yields the same optimum flutter speed as the FOM and yet reduces the computation time significantly, by up to a factor of four.</i></p>

 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>In this paper, optimization is performed on an aeroelastic system for a maximum flutter speed within feasible limits of structural design variables material density, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio and aerodynamic parameters (air density). The aeroelastic model under consideration is Goland wing described by finite element analysis and unsteady vortex lattice method. Gradient based optimization technique and global optimization method are used to seek for the maximum flutter speed. A parametric reduced order model (PROM) is generated using the parametric reduced order modeling technique developed previously by Kim and optimum results are compared against those of the full order model (FOM). It is shown that the optimization based on PROM results in 76.43% reduction in CPU time and yet yields the same optimum flutter result as the FOM.</i></p>

 							<b>Abstract:</b> <i>Aeroelasticity is the study of the interaction between structural dynamics and unsteady flow around the structure. It is an important design consideration for aircrafts as it governs flight performance and stability. Liquid fuel carried by transonic flights sloshes upon structural excitation, and in turn modifies the aeroelastic behavior of the vehicle. The effects of fuel sloshing on aeroelasticity is relatively unexplored in open literature, largely because of the absence of computational tools for this multiphysics problem. This study focuses on the development of computational models for assessment of fuel sloshing effects on aeroelasticity of transonic flights.
							Firstly, a coupling methodology is developed which utilizes existing open-source CFD solvers to obtain high-fidelity numerical solutions. An existing open-source solver interface is modified to enable interaction between the single physics solvers participating in the coupling via data exchange during runtime. However, the coupling is computationally expensive and impractical for time marching solutions such as flutter boundary problems that require multiple simulation runs. The computational cost of the coupled problem is reduced by representing sloshing by an Equivalent Mechanical System (EMS), which comprises of a series of mass-spring systems to simulate linear sloshing. A surrogate model based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) is developed to efficiently describe the dominant nonlinear dynamic characteristics of sloshing in an enclosed vessel. Both EMS and RBF-NN sloshing modes are coupled with CFD based aeroelastic solver to compute the transonic flutter boundary of an airfoil.
							The study is extended to the development of machine learning surrogate models for both aerodynamics and sloshing. Data-driven recurrent neural network based surrogate models are utilized for construction of a computational framework to assess aeroelastic motion of an airfoil and a wing embedded with partially filled fuel tanks. Finally, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is developed to alleviate the data-dependence of black-box surrogate models. PINN incorporates the governing equation of the underlying physical system in the learning process. In this work, PINN is substituted for the aeroelastic equation of motion for demonstration of its implementation and prediction accuracy.</i></p>
